These images were imported into OSP16.1 with the name centos8 appended to differentiate from existing RHEL overcloud images.

Machines were deployed using

# cat storage-baremetal-deploy.yaml 
- name: CephStorage
  count: 2
  defaults:
    image:
      href: overcloud-full-centos8
  instances:
  - hostname: ceph-01
    name: storage-01
  - hostname: ceph-02
    name: storage-02


Firewalling expectations


This playbook expects to be run from a machine that has egress SSH access to all nodes.

Other requirements

o) EPEL packages (see URL config in roles/ceph-perf-pre/defaults/main.yml if need changing to a local mirror)
o) Once deployed, the playbook configures the CentOS8 nodes with the default CentOS8 repo mirrors
